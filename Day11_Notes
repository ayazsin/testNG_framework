*****What Do Remember From the last class?
-TestNG      : Testing Framework. It is advanced version of JUnit
-Annotations : Multiple Before and After Annotations
                -@BeforeSuite @AfterSuite
                -@BeforeTest @AfterTest
                -@BeforeGroups @AfterGroups
                -@BeforeClass @AfterClass
                -@BeforeMethod @AfterMethod
-@Test  : Mark a method as a Test Case. It creates test cases and let us run the cases.
-@Ignore: Skips a test case

***Assertions :
*Hard Assertion : Stops the test execution if the Assertion line fails
*Soft Assertion : Continues to the test execution even if the Assertion line fails.
To use soft assertion we have to create softAssert object.
- SoftAssert sa = new SoftAssert();
sa.assertTrue()....or other assertions you can use
-sa.assertAll() must e used at to mark the assertion as passed or failed
If i don't use this, then the report will always shows as PASS.
